# Open items — ts-convert-from-sisense

Unverified assumptions / follow-ups. Status vocabulary: `TO VERIFY | VERIFIED | KNOWN |
DEFERRED | WONT-FIX`. Each must reach VERIFIED (live or via MCP spec) or be explicitly
deferred before this ships live.

## #1 — Live end-to-end conversion on a real cluster — TO VERIFY (merge gate)

The full chain (`parse` → `build-model` → `ts tml lint` → `ts tml import` → `build-liveboard`)
has been exercised only against synthetic/sample bundles, not a live ThoughtSpot cluster with a
real warehouse connection. Before merge, run a captured Sisense bundle end-to-end on
ps-internal: confirm the Table + Model TMLs validate against a real connection, the model
creates clean (with the prune step removing any engine-rejected formula), and a spot-checked
measure returns faithful numbers (grouped sum equals the ungrouped total, so a `MANY_TO_ONE`
join does not fan out). This is the blocking item for shipping live.

## #2 — Chart-type fidelity via the shared emitter — VERIFIED (design)

The shared emitter (`ts_cli.tableau.liveboard`) is on `main` (merged in #253). `build-liveboard`
emits Answer + tabbed-Liveboard TML directly via the emitter's `build_answer`, passing the
**Sisense-resolved `ts_chart`** (COLUMN/PIE/KPI/…) and status per widget (`answers.build_liveboard_result`).
It deliberately does NOT go through `build_from_spec`'s mark path: main's `build_from_spec`
`_resolve_ct` **re-infers** the chart from a mark and hardcodes `Migrated` (the `ts_chart`-aware
variant is only on the unmerged #255), which would silently mis-type KPIs/pies and hide the
review signal. Driving `build_answer` directly makes the chart mapping correct on today's `main`,
**independent of #255**. The Sisense dashboard filter bar is injected as `liveboard.filters`
chips after emission. Live-render fidelity of the emitted TML is covered by #1 / #5.

## #3 — Live Sisense REST fetch not built — DEFERRED

The converter consumes an **offline bundle JSON** (`{dashboard, widgets, datamodel}`) already on
disk; there is no command that pulls a dashboard, its widgets, and the datamodel directly from a
Sisense server's REST API. A user must assemble the bundle from a Sisense export first. A future
`ts sisense fetch` (following the `.claude/rules/ts-cli.md` "new command" flow: MCP-spec the
Sisense REST endpoints, verify live, then add the command) would close this. Deferred — the
offline path is the intended v1 surface.

## #4 — JAQL formula subset breadth — TO VERIFY on real dashboards

The deterministic `FUNCTION_MAP` / `AGG_MAP` in `ts_cli/sisense/functions.py` covers the common
subset observed in the sample bundles. Against a broader set of real customer dashboards, some
functions currently emitted as Migrated may still be rejected by the ThoughtSpot engine (e.g.
`median`, `stddev`/`variance` argument shapes), and some now marked NEEDS REVIEW may turn out to
have a safe deterministic port. Confirm against real JAQL on the first few live migrations; the
runtime prune step (Step 2) is the safety net until then.

## #5 — Numeric-range / date-bucket filter-chip fidelity — TO VERIFY live

The dashboard-filter → Liveboard-chip mapping (member→`IN`, exclude→`NOT_IN`, numeric range→
`GE`/`GT`/`LE`/`LT`/`BW_INC`/`BW`/`EQ`; date `level`→`HOURLY…YEARLY`) is derived from the
standalone converter and the worked examples, not yet round-tripped through a live Liveboard
import. Confirm the chip operators and bucket tokens render and filter correctly on a real
Liveboard. **Specifically verify the two-sided range boundary:** ThoughtSpot exposes `BW_INC`
(both-inclusive) and `BW` (both-exclusive); a **mixed** inclusive/exclusive Sisense range
(e.g. `from:10, toNotEqual:100`) keeps both bounds but is emitted as `BW_INC`, so the exact
open/closed boundary is approximate — confirm whether a mixed-bound operator exists on the
target build and tighten if so.
