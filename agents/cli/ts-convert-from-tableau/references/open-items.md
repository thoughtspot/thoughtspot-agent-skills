## #1 — VALIDATE_ONLY policy in ts CLI — NEEDS VERIFICATION

The skill uses `ts tml import --policy VALIDATE_ONLY` for the fix loop. Verify that the
`ts` CLI supports this policy flag and returns structured error JSON (not just HTTP status).

Alternative: if VALIDATE_ONLY is unsupported, use `--policy PARTIAL` with a dry-run flag,
or call the REST v2 endpoint directly:
`POST /api/rest/2.0/metadata/tml/import` with `{"import_policy": "VALIDATE_ONLY", "dry_run": true}`

Status: NEEDS VERIFICATION against live cluster

---

## #2 — Connection schema fetch for empty `externalDatabases` — VERIFIED WORKAROUND

When the REST v2 `connections get` endpoint returns no tables (empty `externalDatabases`),
the Callosum `fetchConnection` API can be used with an explicit `database` parameter.
However, the `ts` CLI may not expose this. In that case, ask the user for the database
name and proceed with `YOUR_DATABASE`/`YOUR_SCHEMA` placeholders — ThoughtSpot issues a
warning, not an error, for placeholder values.

Status: WORKAROUND DOCUMENTED in Step 4

---

## #3 — COLLECTION datasources — NOT IMPLEMENTED

Tableau COLLECTION datasources (multiple primary data sources combined) should generate
one model per underlying table. This edge case is not handled in v1.0.0.

Status: DEFERRED to v1.1.0

---

## #4 — Custom SQL relations — PARTIAL

When a Tableau relation uses custom SQL, the skill extracts the physical table name from
the SQL string (table after `FROM`). Complex multi-table SQL or subqueries are not handled.

Status: PARTIAL — simple `FROM table` pattern only

---

## #5 — Answer TML inline vs. separate import — NEEDS VERIFICATION

The skill generates answer content inline within the liveboard's `visualizations` section.
Verify that this structure imports correctly — specifically that `answer:` blocks nested
inside `visualizations[]` are accepted by `ts tml import`.

Status: NEEDS VERIFICATION against live cluster

---

## #6 — Liveboard layout coordinate system — NEEDS VERIFICATION

Step 9c maps Tableau 0–100,000 coords to a ThoughtSpot 12-column grid. Verify:
- The exact column width unit ThoughtSpot uses in TML (is it 1/12 of the liveboard width?)
- The height unit (pixels? rows? a relative unit?)
- The minimum and maximum tile height values

Reference: `thoughtspot-liveboard-tml.md` schema doc for exact field semantics.

Status: NEEDS VERIFICATION

---

## #7 — NOTE_TILE structure — NEEDS VERIFICATION

The skill generates `viz_type: NOTE_TILE` with `note_tile.content`. Verify the exact TML
structure for note tiles against the liveboard TML schema, especially:
- Is `viz_type` the correct field name?
- What is the supported `background_color` format?
- Can note tiles contain HTML or markdown?

Status: NEEDS VERIFICATION

---

## #8 — Multi-datasource worksheets — NOT IMPLEMENTED

Tableau worksheets can blend data from multiple datasources. v1.0.0 assumes each worksheet
uses a single datasource. Blended worksheets will produce an incomplete liveboard
visualization.

Status: DEFERRED to v1.1.0

---

## #9 — Tab support (multiple dashboards → tabs) — NOT IMPLEMENTED

When a Tableau workbook has multiple dashboard sheets, v1.0.0 creates one liveboard per
dashboard. ThoughtSpot supports liveboard tabs — grouping all dashboards into a single
multi-tab liveboard is a better migration output but requires the liveboard tabs TML
structure.

Status: DEFERRED to v1.1.0
